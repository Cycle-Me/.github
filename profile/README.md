## Introduction
CycleMe is a mobile application that enables users to classify waste based on pictures they capture. The app requires camera access and an active internet connection. With CycleMe, you can share your recycling journey through the Feed feature, where you can post images and videos accompanied by captions. Other than that, you can interact with other users by leaving comments on their posts. If you have recycled products to sell, our Marketplace feature has you covered. Please ensure that you follow any guidelines or restrictions provided by the app for content upload in the Feed feature and adhere to specific policies related to selling products in the Marketplace. We hope you enjoy using CycleMe!
